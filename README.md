Hi, I’m Emmanuel Popoola, a Data Analyst with a Computer Science background, now transitioning into Data Engineering. I’ve mastered Python, SQL, R, and Power BI, and I’m currently focused on learning ETL processes, Data Warehousing, and Big Data technologies.
Eager to apply my analytical skills to build scalable data solutions and optimize data pipelines.
Looking to collaborate on projects that bridge data analysis and engineering to solve business challenges.
Fun fact: I love playing chess, a great way to unwind and sharpen my strategic thinking!
